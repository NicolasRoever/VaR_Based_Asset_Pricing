# VaR Based Asset Pricing
---
This repository is a playground for an idea I had deriving asset price formulas from VaR-based risk constraints.

Problem: The model yields unrealistic predictions. Let's see what I can change :)

To-Dos

- Start with the classical markowitz formulation and check if you get realistic results there
- Then add the VaR constraint and see what happens
- Please make helper functions (and rename the functions i.e. formula_expected_value
